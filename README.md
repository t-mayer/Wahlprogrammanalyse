# Wahlprogrammanalyse

The German federal election is coming up on the 26th of September 2021. This event is perceived as very important for two reasons. First, German chancellor Angela Merkel will retire after 16 years to make way for a new chancellor. Second, various significant events such as Covid-19, climate change, and political corruption  have shaped the opinion and views of the German population. For these two reasons, it is very likely that the political landscape as well as the new Bundestag will experience a major change.
